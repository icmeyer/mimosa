MIMOSA - An MOC code by Isaac Meyer

All scripts to execute the files are contained within the geometries folder.
Each should be able to run by importing the modules located in this directory
and using that to solve the problem. Some parts of the code must be changed
for specific runs, for example when using vacuum boundary conditions make sure
that k is calculated by iterations and not from a balance because leakage is not 
implemented in the balance calculation.
